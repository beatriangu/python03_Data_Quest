# Python Module 03 – Data Quest

This project is part of the Python curriculum.

The goal of this module is to master Python collections and data processing techniques
through practical, game-inspired data engineering exercises.

## Topics covered

- Command-line arguments (`sys.argv`)
- Lists and basic analytics
- Tuples and coordinate systems
- Sets and uniqueness analytics
- Dictionaries and inventory systems
- Generators and streaming data
- List, dict and set comprehensions

## Exercises completed

### Exercise 0 – Command Quest
**Concepts:** `sys.argv`, command-line arguments, program execution flow

A command-line program that:
- Reads arguments passed from the terminal
- Distinguishes between the program name and user-provided arguments
- Handles the case where no arguments are given
- Displays structured output following the subject specifications

This exercise introduces how Python programs receive external input.

### Exercise 1 – Score Cruncher
**Concepts:** Lists, basic statistics, `try/except`

A score analytics program that:
- Receives player scores from the command line
- Stores valid scores in a list
- Computes basic statistics (total, average, min, max, range)
- Handles invalid input gracefully without crashing

This exercise demonstrates why lists are ideal for sequential data processing
and how to manage real-world input errors.
