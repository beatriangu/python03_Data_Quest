Python Module 03 – Data Quest

This project is part of the Python curriculum.

The goal of this module is to practice Python collections and data processing
through a series of small, game-inspired command-line exercises.
Each exercise focuses on handling input data, applying basic analytics,
and producing structured output according to the subject specifications.

Topics covered

Command-line arguments (sys.argv)

Program execution flow

Lists and basic analytics

Error handling with try/except

Exercises completed
Exercise 0 – Command Quest

Concepts: sys.argv, command-line arguments, program execution flow

A command-line program that:

Reads arguments passed from the terminal

Distinguishes between the program name and user-provided arguments

Handles the case where no arguments are given

Displays structured output following the subject specifications

This exercise introduces how Python programs receive external input
and how to manage basic command-line interaction.

Exercise 1 – Score Cruncher

Concepts: Lists, basic statistics, try/except

A score analytics program that:

Receives player scores from the command line

Stores scores in a list

Computes basic statistics (total, average, minimum, maximum and range)

Handles invalid input gracefully without crashing

This exercise demonstrates why lists are suitable for sequential data processing
and how to manage common input errors in a controlled way.

Project structure

The project follows a simple and clear structure, where each exercise is
self-contained in its own directory, as required by the subject.

How to run

From the root of the project, execute each exercise using:

python3 ex00/ft_command_quest.py [arguments]
python3 ex01/ft_score_analytics.py [scores]


Examples:

python3 ex00/ft_command_quest.py hello world
python3 ex01/ft_score_analytics.py 1500 2300 1800 2100 1950

Notes

All programs use only the Python standard library.

The output format strictly follows the subject requirements.

No external dependencies are required.
